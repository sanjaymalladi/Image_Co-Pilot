# Dynamic Viral Marketing Prompts - Real-World Intelligence üß†üöÄ

## The Problem with Static Prompts
Before: Generic templates that don't understand the product
- Same "dramatic angle" for a phone case and a coffee mug
- No context about what makes THIS product special
- Missing the "photographer's eye" for what would actually work

## The Solution: AI Creative Director üéØ

Now the system thinks like a **real creative director** would:

### üß† Product Intelligence
The AI analyzes the actual product and asks:
- "What makes THIS specific product special?"
- "What angles would make people stop scrolling?"
- "How would a top agency shoot this for maximum viral potential?"
- "What's this product's 'hero moment'?"

### üé® Contextual Creativity
Instead of generic shots, it creates:
- **Phone Case**: Might suggest dramatic drop-test scenarios, lifestyle integration with tech setup, or artistic flat-lay with complementary tech
- **Coffee Mug**: Could create steam-art moments, cozy morning scenes, or artistic pour shots
- **Headphones**: Might focus on music visualization, lifestyle integration, or dramatic audio-wave compositions
- **Skincare**: Could suggest before/after transformations, ingredient close-ups, or spa-like luxury scenes

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 1: Product Analysis
```
Input: "Wireless noise-canceling headphones, matte black finish, premium materials..."
```

### Step 2: AI Creative Director Thinking
```
"This is a premium audio product. What would make someone screenshot this?
- The moment when music hits perfectly
- Lifestyle integration with creative work
- Dramatic audio visualization
- Minimalist tech aesthetic"
```

### Step 3: Dynamic Viral Concepts
```
Generated Shots:
1. "Audio Visualization Hero" - Headphones with visible sound waves
2. "Creative Flow State" - Person in perfect focus zone with headphones
3. "Tech Minimalism" - Clean geometric composition highlighting design
4. "Music Moment" - Capturing the exact moment when the beat drops
```

## The AI Creative Director Prompts üé≠

The system uses advanced prompting to think like a real creative:

"You are a world-class creative director and viral marketing expert.

Think like a real photographer/creative director would:
- What makes this specific product special?
- What angles/scenarios would make people stop scrolling?
- How would a top agency shoot this for maximum viral potential?

For each shot, think about:
- What would make someone screenshot this?
- What angle hasn't been done before?
- How does this product fit into aspirational lifestyle?
- What's the 'wow factor' for this specific item?"
```
