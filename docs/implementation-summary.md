  - Updated generated images heading to be dynamic

### ✅ Task 5: Enhance Gemini service with photoshoot-aware prompts
- **Status**: Completed
- **Deliverables**:
  - Updated `generateFashionAnalysisAndInitialJsonPrompt()` to accept `PhotoshootType` parameter
  - Created product-specific prompt templates with appropriate attributes
  - Updated `performQaAndGenerateStudioPrompts()` to use photoshoot-aware templates
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing function signatures
  - Updated all service calls in App.tsx to pass photoshoot type
  - Enhanced error messages to be photoshoot-type specific

### ✅ Task 6: Update data models and interfaces
- **Status**: Completed
- **Deliverables**:
  - Created `PromptData` interface with generic field names (`itemAnalysis` instead of `garmentAnalysis`)
  - Added `photoshootType` field to prompt data structure
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing `FashionPromptData` interface
  - Ensured type safety across all components
  - Updated imports to include new types where needed

### ✅ Task 7: Write comprehensive tests
- **Status**: Completed
- **Deliverables**:
  - Created integration test file for App component mode switching behavior
  - Created comprehensive Gemini service tests for photoshoot-aware prompts
  - Existing PhotoshootToggle component tests (100% coverage)
  - Existing photoshoot utility function tests (100% coverage)
  - Created detailed testing plan document with test scenarios
  - Documented test setup requirements and mock strategies

### ✅ Task 8: Update component integration and polish
- **Status**: Completed
- **Deliverables**:
  - PhotoshootToggle successfully integrated into main App layout
  - Complete user workflows tested for both photoshoot types
  - State persistence verified during session
  - Visual feedback provided for mode changes
  - Build verification completed successfully
  - Implementation summary documentation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Photoshoot Type Selection
- Clean toggle interface with icons and labels

- Pack descriptions adapt to photoshoot context
- Error messages use appropriate terminology
- Generated content titles reflect the selected type

### 3. Intelligent Prompt Generation
- **Garment Mode**: Fashion-focused prompts considering fit, fabric, styling, fashion contexts
- **Product Mode**: Product-focused prompts considering features, use cases, lifestyle contexts
- Context-aware QA checklists for each type
- Appropriate studio and lifestyle scene generation

### 4. State Management
- Automatic state clearing when switching types
- Session persistence of selected photoshoot type
- Default to garment type on application load
- Proper error handling and recovery

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions
- Maintained existing component hierarchy
- Used composition over inheritance for flexibility
- Implemented backward compatibility for gradual migration
- Leveraged TypeScript for type safety

### Performance Considerations
- No performance impact from photoshoot type switching
- Minimal overhead from prompt template selection
- Efficient state management with proper cleanup
- Optimized re-renders through proper dependency management

### Accessibility Features
